Creating an NFL Player Valuation System (PVS) using important historical data
  Goal:
    - To show how much value a specific player provides to their team
    - Able to use in contract negotiations to prove players "value"
    - Assist franchises with using their salary cap efficiently and correctly
    - Equate a PVS statistic with money value to give true valuation
    - Keep the NFL market steady with a slower "inflation" rate
    - Assure the top paid players are truly worth the rank
  Process:
    - Gather data and find most correlated statistics with winning games
        - Linear Regression, x=statisitc y=games won
    - Weigh each statisitc according to strength of correlation
        - Ex: 1:PassTD, 2:RushYD, etc.
    - Provide numerical value for each weight
        - Ex: PassTD=2x, RushYD=1.7x
    - Create a ratio of statisitc to team total multiplied by weight
        - Ex: (3,000/5,000)*1.7
    - Develops PVS statistic for each player by team value
    - Connect PVS to dollar value for player contract worth
    - Produce Python script to repeat for all NFL players
    - Establish website to display player statisitcs
  Challenges:
    - Data collection
    - Data Scraping
    - Statisitc Creation
  Drawbacks:
    - Statistic will not be able to accomodate for injuries, leadership traits, personality
    - Finding ways to value non-skill players since limited data (PFF grades?)
