# MLB WAR to NFL WAR
# Player Valuation System
# PV = PC*(WC) + YC*(WC) - GC*(WC)
  # PV = Player Value
  # PC = Points Contributed
  # YC = Yards Contributed
  # GC = Giveaways Contributed (Deduction)
    # All as Part of Whole through Weighted System Based on Previous Historical Success 
# Use Air Yards for QB Passing as it shows true value of QB and gives more value to skill player after catch
# Find Each Position's Points, Yards, Giveaways Contributed to the Team (Offense)
